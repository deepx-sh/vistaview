## Overview

VistaView is a community-driven travel platform with three distinct user roles  **User**, **Owner**, and **Admin**  each with their own dedicated interface and permissions. Owners can list and manage tourism places, users can review them, and admins oversee the entire platform.

```

**Data flow for protected routes:**
1. RTK Query sends request with `credentials: include`
2. `authMiddleware` verifies access token from HTTP-only cookie
3. On 401, `baseQueryWithReauth` silently calls `/auth/refresh-token`
4. New access token is set; original request retries automatically

## Key Implementation Details

### Silent Token Refresh
RTK Query's `baseQuery` is wrapped to automatically retry requests after refreshing the access token on 401 responses, providing a seamless auth experience without redirecting users to login.

### Geospatial Search
MongoDB's `2dsphere` index on the `location` field enables `$near` queries for finding places within a specified radius. The frontend uses OpenStreetMap's Nominatim API for reverse geocoding when a user picks a location on the map.

### Optimistic Wishlist Updates
Wishlist add/remove mutations use RTK Query's `onQueryStarted` to optimistically update the cached wishlist before the server responds, with automatic rollback on failure.

### Spam Detection
A lightweight scoring function evaluates review comments for spam signals (short length, known spam keywords, excessive caps, emoji overload) and stores a `spamScore` on each review for admin moderation.
